# tvh-es

Stash tvheadend recording information and stats in Elasticsearch for fun.

Do fun things like:

* Graph the data and transport errors per channel over time.
* Graph the time spent recording per channel.
* Graph the time spent recording per show.
* Graph the most common time of day for recording.
* Graph the most popular channel.

Stuff like that.
